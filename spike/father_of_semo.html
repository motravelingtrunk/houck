        <h1>Louis Houck: The Father of Southeast Missouri</h1>
        <p>
            Both of Louis Houck’s railroads increasingly drew Southeast Missouri to the economies of the Midwest
            and beyond. His railroads utilized other lines to reach markets outside of the Southeast region,
            which was possible through the intersection of his <em>St. Louis, Kennett & Southern Railroad</em> with
            his rival Jay Gould’s line the <em>St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad</em> at Delta, Missouri. Because
            these two railroads met, a merchant in Southeast Missouri could carry on commerce, or business,
            with merchants in St. Louis or Chicago. In addition, through Houck’s <em>St. Louis, Cape Girardeau,
            Ft. Smith Railroad</em>, merchants also had access to Kansas City in Western Missouri, as well as
            South to Memphis, Tennessee. Trade was also promoted with Southeast Arkansas through these railroads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the changing face of the economy in Southeast Missouri due to Houck’s railroads, investors
            from the East coast of the United States were drawn to the area, buying stock in Houck’s companies.
            Investors from all over the country were attracted to the Southeast Missouri region—this in itself
            reveals the important and valuable role that Houck’s railroad played in Southeast Missouri’s
            growth during the 1890s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Houck’s railroads were very successful, they did not come about without competition. One of
            his major competitors was a man by the name of Jay Gould. Gould owned and controlled the <em>St.
            Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad</em>, which ran through Southeast Missouri and was a direct competitor
            with Houck’s <em>St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Ft. Smith Railroad</em>. Not to mention, Gould was interested
            in gaining control of Houck’s other rail road (the <em>St. Louis, Kennett & Southern Railroad</em>). This
            competition proved that there was potential growth for Southeast Missouri.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it came to which line Southeast Missourians trusted more, the decision laid in who controlled
            the railroad from where. Local merchants liked it better when the railroad was locally owned
            instead of by outside parties. When the railroad was owned locally, profits made from it could
            be returned to the community. But if the railroad was owned from out of the region, profit would
            benefit the outside community and not the community in which the railroad operates.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Louis Houck headquartered his operations in Southeast Missouri</li>
            <li>Jay Gould headquartered his operations in New York</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the economy in Southeast Missouri took a turn for the worst, Houck would be affected more so than
            Gould, proving that he has more to lose. Since Houck had more to lose, he put more time and effort
            into operating his railroad, which is something local merchants liked. Gould on the other hand
            would not suffer as much, leaving local merchants to believe he would not care for them as much
            as Houck did. This proved that Southeast Missouri could be successful through Houck’s railroads
            if they were willing to withstand outside competition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Houck-Gould conflict turned Houck’s railroad into a symbol for the people in Southeast Missouri.
            This symbol came to be after Houck won a Supreme Court case over Gould, which revolved around
            who would control the <em>St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Ft. Smith Railroad</em>. Houck’s victory was not
            only a personal one, but a victory for Southeast Missouri.
