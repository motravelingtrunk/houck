        <h1>Louis Houck: The German Printer and Lawyer</h1>
        <p>
            Louis Houck was born in Mascoutah, Illinois in 1840 to German immigrant and printer Bartholomeaus Hauck.
            Bartholomeaus eventually made his way to Belleville, Illinois with his family where he opened
            the
            <em>Belleviller Zeitung</em>, which published its first issue on January 11, 1849. At just 9
            years old, Louis Houck began working side-by-side with his father in the family printshop, learning
            the tools of the trade about publishing a German-language newspaper.

            Growing up, Louis Houck’s father put him in the German Evangelical school in Belleville, Illinois, a
            Catholic school. Occasionally, Houck’s father sent him to Herman, Missouri where he received
            instruction in German from German newspaperman Emil Muehl. From his experience working with Muehl,
            Houck gained an interest in the stories German newspapers published, and had a deeper interest
            and respect for the German newspaper business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking little English, Houck went to the University of Wisconsin at age 17. He attended the university
            for 3 months and studied English, German, Latin, and Greek. After Houck returned to Illinois
            after his studies, he was asked by Politian William M. Morrison, Democrat, to start a German
            newspaper of his own in the interest of the Democratic Party. Houck agreed, and in 1859 he started
            <em>Volksblatt</em>.

            When he was away at the University of Wisconsin, Houck became interested in the ideas and ideals of the
            Democratic Party. Most Germans in Illinois were Republicans and did not agree with what the Democrats
            stood for. So, Houck’s newspaper was not liked by people, especially Germans, in Belleville.
            Houck often wrote about how he did not agree with President Abraham Lincoln’s politics, which
            angered people—most people agreed with Lincoln. On May 10, 1864, a group of armed soldiers came
            and destroyed <em>Volksblatt</em>. Houck vowed that he would repair the damage and keep
            printing, although business efforts were eventually abandoned.
        </p>

            Louis Houck moved on from German printing and decided to travel down the law path. He was admitted to
            the Illinois Bar, which means he was licensed to practice law in the state of Illinois, and established
            a law practice in Cairo, Illinois around 1865. In 1869 Houck moved from Cairo to St. Louis, Missouri
            where he established a different law firm in partnership with Robert G. Ranney. That same year
            Houck was appointed Assistant United States District Attorney, a position he resigned from when
            Ulysses S. Grant became president in 1869.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in 1869 after coming to a dead end in his career, Houck decided to move to Cape Girardeau, Missouri
            stating that "a move from the city to the country would enable an individual to wield greater
            influence and accomplish more."
