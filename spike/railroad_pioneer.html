        <h1>Louis Houck: The Railroad Pioneer</h1>
        <p>
            Louis Houck practiced law through the 1880s, then decided to try a new business venture: railroading.
            Houck had no prior experience in railroading, but saw firsthand the increasing need for a railroad
            in Cape Girardeau, which would prove to be a successful business. After abandoning his law practice
            in the 1880s, Houck became involved with the Cape Girardeau Railway Company. Over the next 10
            years he expanded his railroad line.

            In July of 1891, Houck began construction on the <em>St. Louis, Kennett & Southern Railroad</em>, which took
            about 3 years to build. Houck first took control of an existing section of the <em>Cotton Belt Rail
            Line</em> than ran from Campbell, Missouri to Kennett, Missouri. Within 3 years, this existing line
            was added to, connecting Kennett to Caruthersville, Missouri. In addition, this railroad was
            able to reach the Mississippi river and connected with the <em>Cotton Belt Rail Line</em> at Campbell,
            Missouri. This connected with the <em>St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad</em> in Delta, Missouri, establishing
            an avenue of commerce between Southeast Missouri and St. Louis. Not only that, but once the Campbell
            line connected with the <em>Cotton Belt Railroad</em>, there was access by railroad from Delta, Missouri
            in the north all the way south to Arkansas.

            The connection of Southeast Missouri to St. Louis by railroad opened up the market for merchants
            in the rural Southeast of Missouri. Rural communities were able to ship raw materials like timber
            and agricultural products to other regions, and St. Louis was able to ship its manufactured goods
            into these regions, opening up a market for them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Houck constructed a second railroad line as well: the <em>St. Louis, Cape Girardeau, Ft. Smith Railroad</em>.
            This line extended to Southwest Missouri from Cape Girardeau to Hunter, Missouri. It provided
            Southwest communities the opportunity to ship their goods directly to the Mississippi River,
            and provided a more direct line to the Mississippi than Houck’s competitors (such as the <em>St.
            Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad</em>). The isolated regions of Southwest Missouri were now able to
            gain access to the railroad traffic, which they were isolated from before the creation of this
            railroad line.
