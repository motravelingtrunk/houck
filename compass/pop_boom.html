        <h1>Immigration: Population Boom</h1>
        <p>
            The economic success brought on by Houck’s railroads created an atmosphere in Southeast Missouri that
            attracted many people to the area. People moved to the area from regions close to Southeast Missouri,
            from regions outside the state of Missouri, and even from outside of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            A growing atmosphere attracted people to the area and caused a rise in the population. From 1890-1900,
            the period during and after Houck built his railroads, the population rose by 34,000 people.
            This increase was in part due to settlers who looked at Southeast Missouri not only for its resources
            and booming economy, but also for its transportation. Merchants were able to transport their
            goods by railroad to various parts of the Midwest, which they were unable to do elsewhere in
            Missouri. Not only that, but merchants and locals were able to receive manufactured goods from
            other parts of the Midwest. Railroads were also able to carry passengers, making it easier for
            people to come to Southeast Missouri, as well as travel to other parts of the Midwest. Thus,
            this railroad system attracted people from all across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because raw materials and goods were able to be transported to regions throughout the Midwest and beyond,
            entrepreneurs were attracted to the area. With the growing number of entrepreneurs in Southeast
            Missouri, diversified products and services were able to be offered, which drew even more attention
            to the area. The lumber industry in the region boomed as well—the railroad provided a better
            mode of transportation to ship timber, which helped ease the harvesting and processing of wood
            products in the region. Milling companies also profited from clearing the land where the railroads
            were going to be constructed.
        </p>
        <p>
            As people from all across the globe settled in Southeast Missouri, the population began to diversify.
            People of different backgrounds brought influences and customs from their home place and shared
            them with the people of the region. These customs turned into products and services offered,
            which helped to create a positive economic climate for Southeast Missouri. As the economy grew
            more and more prosperous, property value began to rise, creating an atmosphere that was very
            welcoming and profitable for outsiders.
