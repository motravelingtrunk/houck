        <h1>Immigration: Labor for the Railroad</h1>
        <p>
            During the construction of Houck’s railroads, there was not enough local manpower to help build the railroad
            and Houck was forced to hire laborers from outside the region. The construction of the <em>St. Louis,
            Kennett & Southern Railroad</em> especially needed more manpower than what was available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the years 1893 and 1894 more than 200 workers, most of who were Irish immigrants, cleared, graded
            (leveling out the ground), and drove piles at various points in the survey line (the ground where
            the railroad was going to be constructed). These immigrants lived in camps on the site and worked
            on the railroad in separate groups. They would chop down tall grass, cut down hundreds of Cypress
            and Oak trees that were on the land, lead teams of Ox to remove tree stumps from the ground,
            and stacked lumber along the line route so the construction groups could quickly and easily access
            the material. During the construction of one of his later railroad lines, some of Houck’s local
            workers refused to work in the cold, leaving him no other choice but to bring in hundreds of
            new laborers from St. Louis. These laborers were both Greek and Italian, and interpreters came
            to Southeast Missouri with them as well so people could translate to English what they were saying.
            Upon hesitation, Houck also employed local African American workers as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Houck wanted workers that were smart and quick learning to be on his labor team, though with shortage
            of labor, that was not always the case. He had little patience for slow-learning workers, and
            became angry when he had to explain every step of the labor process to them—time is money, and
            every time Houck had to stop and explain something to a group of workers, he was losing profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of Houck’s railroads were poorly constructed. Even though Houck cut costs where he could in order
            to construct the railroads at a cheaper cost, the bad construction was largely due to the fact
            that most of Houck’s workers were unskilled in railroad construction—they did not have previous
            training in building railroads, they just needed a job in order to be able to make money to live
            off of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Houck paid his workers, he often paid them late and not as frequently as he should have. He also
            regularly stopped construction and laid off the workers who were working on the project. In order
            for Houck to save money in his railroading venture and cut costs, these layoffs were necessary.
            Laid off workers often wrote letters to Houck explaining how being fired from the job affected
            their family and ability to have decent living conditions or food supply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only did these layoffs affect workers, but they also effected the local merchants. Local merchants
            depended on these workers as consumers, or people who buy from the merchants. Without a salary
            or income, any money these laid off workers had went into buying food instead of buying goods
            from local merchants.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 1890s in the United States, laborers from across the country were going on strike for better
            salary, working conditions, and better and safer working hours. These labor strikes were especially
            hurtful to the railroading business with the outbreak of the Pullman Strike in the Summer of
            1894, where people boycotted (stopped using) and disrupted railroad traffic in the Midwest in
            order to push for better labor benefits. Surprisingly, Houck’s workers did not go on strike.
            These workers believed that once the railroad was complete their economic condition would be
            improved. They also felt powerless against one of the most prominent men in Southeast Missouri,
            deciding that going on strike would do no good.
