        <h1>Gold vs Silver: The Gold Standard vs The Silver Standard</h1>
        <p>
            During the 1890s, one of the biggest political feuds revolved around which monetary coinage was to be
            used in the United States: Gold or Silver. This debate set the tone of the nation, sparking heated
            debates between both the Democrats and the Republicans. This issue was settled when the Republican
            nominee, William McKinley, defeated the Democratic nominee, William Jennings Bryan, in the 1896
            presidential election. The Gold Standard was implemented.
        </p>

            The Gold Standard, first adopted in 1873, was favored by the Republican Party. This standard restricted
            the money supply that was in circulation, but was argued to have stable value. The stable value
            was thought to have been good for business, which in turn was thought to have been good for workers.
            These “Gold Bugs,” a nickname for supporters of the Gold Standard, believed that silver coinage
            would lead to fluctuation of values, ruin credit, and turn business decisions into a wild gamble.

            The Silver Standard, or Free-Silver movement, was favored by the Democratic Party. This movement argued
            that a restricted money supply from gold would lead to lower wages and depressed prices for
            farmers and others. These “Silverites,” the nickname for supporters of the Free-Silver movement,
            pushed to add silver coins to the money supply, arguing that it would make more money available
            for higher wages, for farmers’ profits, and for people in debt who needed to pay off loans. They
            thought it would also boost profits for Western silver mine owners and benefit their employees.

            Although this national debate had little effect on the Southeast Missouri region, it most definitely
            had an impact on Louis Houck and how he conducted his railroad business. Houck was a leading
            Free-Silver Democrat in the state of Missouri, pushing and promoting its benefits to those around
            him whenever he could, as well as paying his workers in silver coins. While constructing his
            railroads, and before any business decisions were made, he had to determine what effect a gold
            or silver standard would have on money that was invested in his project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Houck felt that the national money supply was unstable, noting that the national economy was not as strong
            as it could have been. Because of this, Houck limited the amount of money he was willing to invest
            into the railroads. His hesitation on investment often led to abandoned projects, laying off
            workers, a delay in paying his workers, and an increased motivation to gather the interest of
            outside investors. The gold versus silver debate impacted how Houck decided to expand his railroad,
            which in turn had an impact on the economy of Southeast Missouri.
